## Human behavior analysis

- Education: stupid training from 國家教育研究院
  - Using machine learning to grade 校長's speech
  - 聲音片段偵測
  - normalization of grading habits from different judges
  - Dense Unit Acoustic Features(聲音特性描述)
  - K-Means Bag-of-word encoding
  - 肢體動作特徵計算: Dense trajectory / Gaussian mixed model Fisher encoding
  - Let computer understands SOUND and VIDEO
  - Evaluate Spearman correlation coefficient
  - + Speech contents

## Learning from big video data

- Problem solved: the problem of Control Room
- 99% of video contents are irrelevant
- false-alarm issue
- computer vision to solve the problem
- adopt Bayesian instead of traditional computer vision methods
- feature extraction > bag of words > classifier
- Deep learning(ConvNet) > feature extraction > classifier
- learning feature extract, learning classifier
- finding out people is very important in surveilance industry
- Computer Vision + NLP: image caption

## Crowd sourcing

- Deep AI needs **BIG** and **LABELLED** data
- Wisdom of crowds
- how to label big data: scalability v.s. quality
- online opinions may be easily manipulated
- multiple applications for crowd-sourcing

## Speech processing and deep learning

- how to do speech recognition with deep learning?
- word-based > fb ai group > naive methods

## Mining visual data

- distance in photo reveals relationship
- age crossing
- comparing machine v.s. human verification
- fashion mining: prediction
- location classification from {photo, user, profile}
